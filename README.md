# USB-GPIO-EXTENDER
support scripts for Mikrotik

The device can be connected to any Microtik router via a USB port and has 5 discrete inputs and 5 outputs. The proposed script can partially control the device via the ppp-out interface, setting the state of the digital outputs to 1 or 0. With connected equipment (for example, a relay unit), you can turn on/off the load directly from the Microtik router. A relay controlled by a 5V current can not only be controlled, but also receive control power via a USB GPIO EXTENDER.
